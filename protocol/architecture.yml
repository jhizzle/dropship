Listener:
  description: |
    A Listener is created by calling the Listen function. It currently only
    accepts 'udp' as the network. The laddr is the address that the Listener
    will listen to. It receives all data packets from the network connections
    and sends them to the appropriate Receivers. It keeps track of all of the
    Receivers that are currently in operation. If a Receiver is not currently
    active, calls to Accept will return a new Receiver to listen to the
    connection.

Receiver:
  Description: |
    The Receiver is what actually accepts packets, reassembles them into the
    appropriate data stream, and then allows the data stream to be read.
